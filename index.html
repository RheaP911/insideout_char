                    <p>As her name states, Joy is the very essence of happiness, 
                        perkiness, warm feelings and positive feelings in general,
                         as such, she loves to look on the bright side of things.
                          She is by far the most optimistic, confident, peppy, 
                          determined and loving out of all of the emotions, wishing
                           and wanting nothing but the best out of everyone and 
                           everything.</p>

                    <p>As her name suggests, Sadness embodies sorrow, gloom, 
                        and hurt feelings. She is highly sensitive and prone 
                        to tears. Despite being slow, she observes and reads
                        a lot. Sadness possesses common sense and pragmatism,
                        which proved valuable during Rileyâ€™s mind journey.</p>

                    <p>Anger, hence his name, is the literal embodiment of 
                        feelings of rage, irritation, frustration and fiery 
                        feelings in general. He is shown to be short-tempered, 
                        cantankerous and impatient, and has a tendency to be 
                        rude, aggressive, defensive and resentful. His main job
                         is to keep things fair for Riley.</p>

                        of any and all feelings of distain, judgement and revolt.
                         She keeps a watchful eye and is highly skeptical, honest
                          and opinionated of the people Riley finds herself around
                           with, since her main job is to keep Riley from
                            being poisoned, both physically and socially.</p>

                         of primal feelings of being scared and fight-or-flight.
                          He cares very much about Riley's safety and her 
                          well-being and is very concerned about the choices 
                          Riley makes in her life. Unlike the rest of the 
                          Emotions he is wary, jumpy, and suspicious.</p>
